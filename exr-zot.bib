	abstract = {Psychedelic drugs have a long history of use in healing ceremonies, but despite renewed interest in their therapeutic potential, we continue to know very little about how they work in the brain. Here we used psilocybin, a classic psychedelic found in magic mushrooms, and a task-free functional MRI (fMRI) protocol designed to capture the transition from normal waking consciousness to the psychedelic state. Arterial spin labeling perfusion and blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI were used to map cerebral blood flow and changes in venous oxygenation before and after intravenous infusions of placebo and psilocybin. Fifteen healthy volunteers were scanned with arterial spin labeling and a separate 15 with BOLD. As predicted, profound changes in consciousness were observed after psilocybin, but surprisingly, only decreases in cerebral blood flow and BOLD signal were seen, and these were maximal in hub regions, such as the thalamus and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (ACC and PCC). Decreased activity in the ACC/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was a consistent finding and the magnitude of this decrease predicted the intensity of the subjective effects. Based on these results, a seed-based pharmaco-physiological interaction/functional connectivity analysis was performed using a medial prefrontal seed. Psilocybin caused a significant decrease in the positive coupling between the mPFC and PCC. These results strongly imply that the subjective effects of psychedelic drugs are caused by decreased activity and connectivity in the brain's key connector hubs, enabling a state of unconstrained cognition.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the current paper is to compare meditational and dissociative states in terms of their effects on consciousness, attention, affect, cognition, identity, and pain sensitivity. To illustrate these dimensions of dissociation, a case example is presented of a veteran with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder who had particularly severe dissociation symptoms. The Classical Yoga literature is reviewed to examine these dimensions as they pertain to meditational states. Although dissociative and meditational states can involve alterations in consciousness, attention, affect, cognition, identity, and pain sensitivity, the nature of changes in these two states is distinct. Applications of meditation in treatment contexts have made use of some of the powerful techniques for attention control but do not incorporate the full range of practices because of the secular setting of treatment and the goal of symptom relief. The use of meditation as a treatment for dissociation has not been systematically evaluated.},

	abstract = {In the 1950s, researchers in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan began treating alcoholics with d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and achieved significant rates of recovery. Psychiatrists, including Humphry Osmond who coined the term ‘psychedelic’ while working in Saskatchewan, believed that the successful treatment of alcoholism with biochemical means would scientifically prove that the condition was a disease and not the result of a weak or immoral character. Initial experiments demonstrated unprecedented rates of abstinence among alcoholics treated with LSD. The approach gained support from the provincial government, local chapters of Alcoholics Anonymous and the Bureau of Alcoholism, all of which collaborated in a public campaign that supported LSD treatments. Although Alcoholics Anonymous endorsed psychedelic therapy, the Addictions Research Foundation did not. The leading Canadian authority on addictions disputed the findings in Saskatchewan and challenged these advocates of psychedelic treatments to conduct trials with proper controls. Despite subsequent efforts to demonstrate that the success of psychedelic therapy relied on both medical and non-medical factors, the treatment failed to satisfy current medical methodology, embodied in controlled trials. By the late 1960s, LSD had become a popular recreational drug and gained media attention for its association with counter cultural youth, social disobedience and anti-authoritarian attitudes. All this served further to erode support for its clinical status.},

This video was rendered and uploaded in 4k at 60fps.  It seems that it is viewable again on YouTube in 4k, so check it out in high resolution!

To create the detailed colours this video was rendered in 2 passes using Kalles Fraktaler.  The first pass created a broad colour video.  The second pass was used to create a more dense brightness layer using the wave function.  The results were blended using After Effects.

This video is long enough to play your favourite album in the background.  I have chosen some quiet music, but it won't be to everyone's taste. It's very hard to find free music that can be used on YouTube.  If you think this video goes particularly well with certain music, please leave a comment, so others can try it out.

This video appeared on the TV series "The Big Bang Theory".
